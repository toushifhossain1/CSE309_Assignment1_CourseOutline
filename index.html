            <b>Course Content</b> <br>
            This course serves as a comprehensive overview of web technologies and their usage. Essential topics such as
            OSI & TCP/IP architecture, Internet Routing, IP addressing & Domain Name System will be covered. Discussions
            will
            be held on popular browsers, HTML and Cascading Style Sheet, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, Client and Server side
            scripts,
            Scripting (JavaScript, AJAX, XML) with jQuery libraries, Web Servers (IIS, Apache). Students will learn to
            design
            dynamic websites using ASP.NET with SQL server and PHP with My SQL. A brief overview of topics in web
            security such as
            cryptography, digital signatures, digital certificates, authentication & firewall will be provided.
