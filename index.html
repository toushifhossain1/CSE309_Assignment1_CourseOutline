            <b>Course Content</b> <br>
            This course serves as a comprehensive overview of web technologies and their usage. Essential topics such as
            OSI & TCP/IP architecture, Internet Routing, IP addressing & Domain Name System will be covered. Discussions
            will
            be held on popular browsers, HTML and Cascading Style Sheet, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, Client and Server side
            scripts,
            Scripting (JavaScript, AJAX, XML) with jQuery libraries, Web Servers (IIS, Apache). Students will learn to
            design
            dynamic websites using ASP.NET with SQL server and PHP with My SQL. A brief overview of topics in web
            security such as
            cryptography, digital signatures, digital certificates, authentication & firewall will be provided.

            It is the student’s responsibility to gather information about the assignments and covered topics if they
            miss lectures.
            Regular class attendance is mandatory. Points will be taken off for missing class tests. Without 70% of
            attendance,
            sitting for final exam is NOT allowed. According to IUB system students must enter the classroom within the
            first 10
            minutes to get the attendance submitted.
